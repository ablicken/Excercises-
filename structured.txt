The article entitled U.S Holiday Travel, (http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/america_on_the_go/us_holiday_travel/html/entire.html), gives valuable data for a journalist conducting an article on holiday travel.  The article provides detail on the topic by describing the raw data, yet it also includes links to tables within the text to show a more concise way in representing what the article is explaining.  

The ways in which this article was helpful was in the way it presented the data so that it is useful for those looking for raw numbers as well as those who would come to the site for a writen overview of the topic.  

I believe that the site as a whole could look a bit more user friendly and the web design could be presented in a more "viewer friendly" format.  For example, fewer words per page and a bigger font that is not as difficult to read.  An appealing color scheme would also add a touch of atmosphere to the website which in return could drive-in viewers especially with a topic as enjoyable as Holiday Travel.
